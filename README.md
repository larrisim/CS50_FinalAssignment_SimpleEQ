#### Description:
Introducing the Simple Equalizer, a custom plug-in crafted to manipulate the frequency of your chosen audio file in formats such as .wav or .aiff. 

- With the Simple Equalizer, users gain the ability to modify the frequency of an audio file in various ways. The low-cut feature enables the reduction of low-frequency ranges, the high-cut feature trims high-frequency ranges, and the peak feature accentuates frequencies in between. All three have a parameter range from 20Hz to 20kHz to match the hearing range for human ears. 

- The peak feature comes with additional 2 features: Peak Gain and Peak Quality, offering users the flexibility to fine-tune the selected frequency point with greater detail.
 
- Users can also choose from 4 options for the low-cut and high-cut slopes, enabling them to determine the steepness of the cut line according to their preferences. This added versatility ensures that the Simple Equalizer caters to a wide range of user preferences, allowing for a more personalized and nuanced audio adjustment.
